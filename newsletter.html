That is entirely your fault. This exact disclaimer is in effect forever. It will never run out, and you will never ever be able to sue us. Ever. We have made sure of this. We have lawyers. We think. Even if we don't have lawyers, this exact disclaimer will be the only line of defense we need, you can not sue us. Who am I? I have no idea what "In Perpituity" means but I might as well throw that phrase in there as well. Is anybody gonna actually take the time to stop and read this? If so then hi. I could probably just put random text in here at this point. The FitnessGram&trade; Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [[beep]] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [[ding]] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start. Each sold separately results may vary.</marquee></h6>
